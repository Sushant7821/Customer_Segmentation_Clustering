# Customer Segmentation using Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchase behavior and demographic details using unsupervised machine learning techniques.  
By applying clustering algorithms, we aim to identify distinct customer groups that can help businesses create targeted marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and optimize product offerings.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Companies often have large amounts of customer data, but without proper analysis, it’s challenging to understand different customer types and their preferences.  
The goal of this project is to:
- Group customers into meaningful segments using clustering algorithms.
- Discover hidden patterns in customer purchasing behavior.
- Provide insights that can be used for personalized marketing and business decisions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains:
- **Customer demographics** (age, gender, income)
- **Purchase behavior** (spending score, frequency of purchases)
- **Other behavioral indicators**

_Source_: Publicly available sample dataset from Kaggle / UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Cleaning & Manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Clustering Algorithms)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection** – Loading dataset from CSV file.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, removing duplicates.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding patterns and relationships in the data.
4. **Feature Selection** – Choosing relevant features for clustering.
5. **Data Normalization** – Scaling features for optimal clustering performance.
6. **Clustering** – Applying K-Means clustering algorithm.
7. **Cluster Evaluation** – Using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
8. **Visualization** – Plotting clusters for better interpretation.

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Customers were grouped into **X segments** based on spending score and income level.
- High-value customers were identified for premium marketing campaigns.
- Low-engagement customers were recognized for re-engagement strategies.
